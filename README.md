Milestone 1:

### Project Overview: 
This e-commerce application is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and will enable users to browse products, manage their shopping cart, and place orders. The goal is to cover both backend and frontend development, creating a full-stack solution for an online store.

### Key Features:

1. **REST API Creation**:
   - Develop API endpoints for core functionalities, such as user authentication (register, login, logout), product management (CRUD operations), and order processing (create and view orders).
   - Implement authentication using JWT tokens and secure routes to prevent unauthorized access.

2. **Authentication**:
   - Secure login and registration system using JWT and bcrypt to hash passwords.
   - Role-based access control for different user types (admin and customer).

3. **Database Schema Design**:
   - Define Mongoose schemas for users, products, and orders in MongoDB.
   - Set up relationships between collections (e.g., a user can place multiple orders).
   - Implement data validation to ensure correct and secure data storage.

4. **Backend Development**:
   - Build a RESTful API using Node.js and Express to handle client requests.
   - Implement error handling, validation, and security best practices (e.g., CORS, password hashing).
   - Set up the server with essential routes, controllers, and middleware for API management.

5. **Frontend with React**:
   - Develop a responsive UI using React and integrate components for product display, shopping cart, and user login.
   - Use React Router for navigation and Axios to fetch data from the backend.
   - Manage global state (e.g., user authentication and cart) using Reactâ€™s state and Context API.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Deployment**: Consider deploying the backend on platforms like Heroku or DigitalOcean and the frontend on Vercel or Netlify.
- **Scalability**: Ensure the app is scalable by structuring code with modularity and performance optimization in mind.
- **Testing**: Implement basic testing for both backend APIs and frontend components.

### Technologies:
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, bcrypt
- **Frontend**: React, React Router, Axios, CSS Framework (Bootstrap or Material-UI)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Development Tools**: VS Code, Postman (for API testing)
